[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) is a real-time exception reporting service for Ruby and other languages. The Rollbar service will alert you of problems with your code and help you understand them in a ways never possible before. We love it and we hope you will too.

This is the Ruby library for Rollbar. It will instrument many kinds of Ruby applications automatically at the framework level. You can also make direct calls to send exceptions and messages to Rollbar.
