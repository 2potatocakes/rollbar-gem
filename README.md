# Ratchetio

Ruby gem for Ratchet.io, for reporting exceptions in Rails 3 to Ratchet.io. Requires a Ratchet.io account (you can sign up for free).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ratchetio'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ratchetio

Then, run the following command from your rails root:

    $ rails generate ratchetio YOUR_RATCHETIO_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN

That will create the file `config/initializers/ratchetio.rb`, which holds the configuration values (currently just your access token) and is all you need to use Ratchet.io with Rails.

To confirm that it worked, run:

    $ rake ratchetio:test

This will raise an exception within a test request; if it works, you'll see a stacktrace in the console, and the exception will appear in the Ratchet.io dashboard.
